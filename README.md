# LED-Handheld-HMI
# Overview
A HMI code for Arduino-based device with Visual Studio.
LED Handheld is an arduino-based device to monitoring and measuring the parameter of Railway Signal LED. This code developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. 
The device's purposes are mainly to fasten the production and maintenance the railway signal. And transfer the data from the device to the HMI for detail analysis. The HMI will have 2 function, first one is real time measuring, which display graph about the measured parameter, and second is production test, which test the parameter of the railway signal lamp to the normal value and compare them. Both pages can display different version of the railway signal lamp.
